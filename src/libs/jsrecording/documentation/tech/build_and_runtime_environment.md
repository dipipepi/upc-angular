##Use of Undocumented/Internal APIs

Any APIs visible in the library that are not documented or are marked as for internal Avaya use only should not be used by third party applications. These APIs are internal to the Avaya Client Services library and their use by third party applications could result in unpredictable behavior of the resulting application.

No support will be provided by Avaya related to the use of any internal APIs.
